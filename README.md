# Developing-Demonstration-for-Clustering

**Clustering:** 

Clustering is the process of grouping a set of data objects into multiple groups or clus-
ters so that objects within a cluster have high similarity, but are very dissimilar to objects
in other clusters. Dissimilarities and similarities are assessed based on the attribute val-
ues describing the objects and often involve distance measures. Clustering as a data
mining tool has its roots in many application areas such as biology, security, business
intelligence, and Web search.
